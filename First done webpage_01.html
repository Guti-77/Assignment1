<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    This web site generally gives an introduction to 
HTML and CSS.With further development,the site is particularly intended 
to act as a tool with which to familiarise with some of the syntax in 
HTML and CSS.The production of HTML,CSS and others,underlines the practice 
of Front-end web development and users are thus able to directly see and 
interact with a website or web application<p>

<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
<p><img scr="Htmlsymbol_01.jpg" alt="HTML symbol" width=160px height=200px>
    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language used to create webpages.
 Hypertext s a reference to the hyperlinks that may be contained in an 
 HTML page.It is as such,a Markup language rather than a programming language 
 because of the way in which tags semantically define the page layout 
 and elements.There are a number of elements involved in HTML and these 
    and other concepts will be attended in due course.For other definitions see 
    <a href="  https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a></p>

 <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
 <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and is used to format the layout 
     or presentation of webpages.CSS's descriptiveness makes it possible 
     to render HTML elements on displays such as screen or any other media.
     CSS can also be used to define aspects of wepages such as table sizes
     and text styles.Css therefore saves much work because it helps create
     a homogenous look across several pages of a website.Other definitions 
     can be found at <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia.org</a></p>
